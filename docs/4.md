Here's a cool way to port forward multiple services at the same time

#### Bash
```bash
nohup ssh -R 443:localhost:8000 tls@rockz.run &  # website
nohup ssh -R 3000:localhost:1883 tls@rockz.run & # mqtt
nohup ssh -R 3001:localhost:22 rockz.run &       # ssh
```

To find the sessions later...
```bash
ps -ef | grep -i ssh
```
