<!-- :::note
Requires Paid Tier, acceptable ports are within the range 1800-5000

:::note
For now, ports can be in the range of 2222-3333
:::

1. Optionally reserve ports from the console (first come first serve)
2. Forward a service running locally on 8000 to 2424
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/custom_key_name -R 2424:localhost:8000 rockz.one
```

### With tls encryption
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/custom_key_name -R 2424:localhost:8000 tls@rockz.one
```
